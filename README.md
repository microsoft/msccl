# MSCCL

Microsoft Collective Communication Library (MSCCL) is a platform to execute custom collective communication algorithms for multiple accelerators supported by Microsoft Azure.

## Introduction

MSCCL is an inter-accelerator communication framework that is built on top of [NCCL](https://github.com/nvidia/nccl) and uses its building blocks to execute custom-written collective communication algorithms. MSCCL vision is to provide a unified, efficient, and scalable framework for executing collective communication algorithms across multiple accelerators. To achieve this, MSCCL has multiple capabilities:

- Programmibility: Inter-connection among accelerators have different latencies and bandwidths. Therefore, a generic collective communication algorithm does not necessarily well for all topologies and buffer sizes. MSCCL vision is to provide a unique collective communication algorithm for each topology and buffer size. In case no algorithm is available, MSCCL will automatically fall back to a NCCL's generic algorithm. For information regarding how to select a specific algorithm, please refer to [SCCL](https://github.com/microsoft/sccl).
- Topology-Aware Drivers: each accelerator and type of inter-connect requires a driver to complete a primtive send and receive operation. MSCCL provides a link-specific driver for each Azure hardware to maximize the output of the connection.
- Profiling: MSCCL has a profiling tool [NPKit](https://github.com/microsoft/npkit) which provides detailed timeline for each primitive send and receive operation to understand the bottlenecks in a given collective communication algorithms.

MSCCL is the product of many great researchers and interns at Microsoft Research. Below is a list of our publications:

## Example

In order to use MSCCL customized algorithms, you may follow these steps to use two different MSCCL algorithms for AllReduce on Azure NDv4 which has 8xA100 GPUs:

Steps to install MSCCL:

```shell
$ git clone -b lowlatency https://github.com/microsoft/msccl.git
$ cd msccl/
$ make -j src.build
$ cd ../
```

Then, follow these steps to install [nccl-tests](https://github.com/nvidia/nccl-tests) for performance evaluation:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nvidia/nccl-tests.git
$ cd nccl-tests/
$ make MPI=1 NCCL_HOME=../msccl/build/ -j 
$ cd ../
```

To evaluate the performance, execute the following command line on an Azure NDv4 node:

```shell
$ mpirun -np 8 -mca pml ob1 --mca btl ^openib -mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 -mca  coll_hcoll_enable 0  -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=msccl/build/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,ENV -x NCCL_NET_SHARED_BUFFERS=0 -x SCCL_XML_FILES=msccl/src/xml_generator/ar_ll.xml:msccl/src/xml_generator/ar_ll128.xml -x NCCL_ALGO=SCCL,RING,TREE -x CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7  nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf -b 128 -e 64MB -f 2 -g 1 -c 1 -n 1000 -w 1000 -z 0
```

If everything is installed correctly, you should see the following output in log:

```shell
[0] NCCL INFO Connected 2 SCCL algorithms
```

The two algorithms are the two XML files specified by `SCCL_XML_FILES` in the command line. You may remove `SCCL` among `NCCL_ALGO` algorithms to disable the custom algorithms

## Build

To build the library:

```shell
$ cd msccl
$ make -j src.build
```

If CUDA is not installed in the default /usr/local/cuda path, you can define the CUDA path with :

```shell
$ make src.build CUDA_HOME=<path to cuda install>
```

MSCCL will be compiled and installed in `build/` unless `BUILDDIR` is set.

By default, MSCCL is compiled for all supported architectures. To accelerate the compilation and reduce the binary size, consider redefining `NVCC_GENCODE` (defined in `makefiles/common.mk`) to only include the architecture of the target platform :
```shell
$ make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE="-gencode=arch=compute_70,code=sm_70"
```

## Install

To install MSCCL on the system, create a package then install it as root.

Debian/Ubuntu :
```shell
$ # Install tools to create debian packages
$ sudo apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper fakeroot
$ # Build NCCL deb package
$ make pkg.debian.build
$ ls build/pkg/deb/
```

RedHat/CentOS :
```shell
$ # Install tools to create rpm packages
$ sudo yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools
$ # Build NCCL rpm package
$ make pkg.redhat.build
$ ls build/pkg/rpm/
```

OS-agnostic tarball :
```shell
$ make pkg.txz.build
$ ls build/pkg/txz/
```

## Tests

Tests for MSCCL are maintained separately at https://github.com/nvidia/nccl-tests.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nvidia/nccl-tests.git
$ cd nccl-tests
$ make
$ ./build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 256M -f 2 -g <ngpus>
```
